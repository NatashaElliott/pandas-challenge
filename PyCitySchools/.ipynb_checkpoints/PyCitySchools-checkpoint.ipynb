    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* This report summarises the area-wide standardised test results for the schools within the local government area as well as school budget, and size data. The purpose of this report is to draw any observable trends from the data displayed, to help inform future decisions surrounding the budgets and priorities. This report summarises the data through filtering by grade, per student capita, school type, and school size, alongside the average maths and reading scores, and the passing percentages of the student population.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data displayed in reference to school scores by school size suggests that schools with a smaller student population (<1000) achieve higher test results in all areas than schools with a larger student population (2000-5000). This may be due to a number of factors one of which being class sizes, resulting in lower teacher to student ratios in schools with a smaller student population which would potentially allow for more student support during class hours, and less assistance for students in larger class sizes in schools with larger student populations. Additionally due to a smaller student population, teachers will likely experience reduced workloads as they aren't required to manage as many students, resulting in consistency in delivering better outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The data displayed in reference to school type suggests that students from Independent schools achiever higher test results in all areas than students from Government schools. Comparing to the above analysis suggesting that schools with a smaller student population achieve higher test results, we can see that most Independent schools in the data provided have smaller student populations than the government schools in the dataset. The potential reason for this may be due to the increased tuition fees Independent schools receive, which can often lead to fewer opportunities available for student enrolment at Independent schools for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This means that Independent schools can be more selective in accepting potential incoming students which could lead to better outcomes for the whole population.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In conclusion the above analysis provides a minor overview of the potential correlations between students achieving higher test results and student population size and school type. However due to several limitations within this dataset, additional data would be required in order to confirm the previously detailed trends. Suggested reports include collecting data regarding class sizes, tuition fees, and the socioeconomic status of students and schools.\n",
